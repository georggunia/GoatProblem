# GoatProblem
Plays the GoatProblem-Gameshow, differenciates between the wins with both strategies

The goat problem is a well-known problem from probability theory: In each (iteration of the) show, a participant is shown three locked gates. There is a probability of 1/3 of the main prize hiding behind a gate. A goat (symbolizes a rivet), is hidden in the other two gates. The winning show participant chooses one of the three gates, whereupon the showmaster opens a gate behind which there is guaranteed to be a goat. The participant now has the chance to stick with his first choice (strategy A) or to switch (strategy B).

This Program runs 10,000 Iterations of the game show in order to see which strategy has better chances of winning. The result may surprise you.
There is a option to test the "getRemainingDoor" method with your own keyboard inputs.
